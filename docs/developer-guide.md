# Vorm Developer Guide

This guide provides developers with information on how to work with the Vorm project codebase.

## Project Structure

Vorm follows a modular structure for better organization and maintainability:

```
vorm/
├── docs/                            # Documentation
│   └── api/                         # API documentation
├── examples/                        # Example shape grammar definitions
├── scripts/
│   ├── build-binary.lisp            # Script for building executable
│   ├── run-repl.lisp                # Script to start a REPL with vorm loaded
│   └── run-tests.lisp               # Script to run tests
├── src/

├── tests/
│   ├── shapes-test.lisp             # Tests for shapes

├── README.md                        # Project README
└── vorm.asd                         # ASDF system definition
```

## Development Workflow

### Setting up the Development Environment

1. Ensure you have SBCL installed on your system
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fabianopinto/vorm.git
   cd vorm
   ```

### Running Tests

You can run the tests using the Makefile:

```
make test
```

This will run all tests and report on their status.

### Starting a REPL

To start an interactive REPL with the vorm system loaded:

```
make repl
```

When the REPL starts, you'll need to switch to the vorm package:

```lisp
(in-package :vorm)
```

Then you can use the shape grammar functions:

```lisp
;; Create basic shapes
(make-point 10 20)                     ; Create a point at (10,20)
(make-circle 50 50 20)                 ; Create a circle at (50,50) with radius 20

;; Create a simple grammar
(defvar *my-grammar* (parse-grammar
 '(grammar "my-grammar"
    (circle (50 50) 20)
    :rules ((rule (circle (50 50) 20)
                 (polygon (30 30) (70 30) (50 70))))))

;; Generate shapes by applying the grammar
(generate-shapes *my-grammar* 3)
```

### Directory Organization

- **src/**: Contains all source code files organized by functionality (shapes, grammar, transformations, etc.)
- **src/utils.lisp**: Contains utility functions used throughout the system
- **tests/**: Organized to mirror the src/ directory with tests for each component
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for development and testing

## Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. Determine the appropriate source file based on functionality
2. Create a new file if needed, or add to an existing module
3. Add corresponding tests in the matching directory under `tests/`
4. Update the ASDF file if you've added new files

## Visualization Feature

The visualization feature (in development on the `feature-visualization` branch) will provide graphical representation of shapes generated by the grammar system. This will help users understand and debug their shape grammars visually.

### Planned Components

- **Visualization Renderer**: A component for rendering shapes to various output formats
- **Canvas System**: Interface for drawing shapes on various backends (SVG, PNG, interactive UI)
- **Interactive Viewer**: An interactive UI for step-by-step grammar application visualization

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create a new `visualization.lisp` file in the `src` directory
2. Define generic rendering functions that handle all shape types
3. Implement SVG output as the first rendering backend
4. Add interactive rendering through a web interface

### Integration Points

The visualization system will integrate with:

- The shape system for accessing geometric properties
- The interpreter for step-by-step grammar application visualization
- Existing examples to provide visual representations

## Coding Standards

- Follow Common Lisp naming conventions
- Document all functions with docstrings
- Ensure all new code has corresponding tests
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Use appropriate error handling
